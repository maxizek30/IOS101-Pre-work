I’m envisioning a social fitness app that helps users log and track their workouts while staying motivated through friends and community features. It would offer simple authentication (with Google, Apple, or email), an intuitive workout logging process (complete with custom exercises, sets, reps, and weights), and a daily streak system to encourage consistency. Users could share posts, comment on each other’s progress, earn badges, and sync optionally with Apple Health for a more holistic fitness overview. Additionally, built-in notifications and scheduling reminders would help users plan and stick to their workout sessions, with privacy settings available for those who prefer to keep their activities more private.
